			"Mobile Apps for Outdoor Exercise Facilities\n\nThe Hong Kong government has been installing outdoor exercise facilities for older adults since 2002. And starting from 2016, the Government has stepped up its efforts to provide more outdoor exercise facilities across the territory to meet the vision of an age-friendly city and enhance the supporting facilities for seniors. Local studies have shown that outdoor fitness facilities provide a unique platform for older adults with different physical conditions to maintain regular exercise habits and promote physical and mental health.\n\nSome older adults in the community have already used the outdoor exercise facilities to help them maintain regular exercise habits, yet most of them do not know how to utilise the facilities safely and effectively. In view of this, a team of experts from the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University rescripted a more detailed introduction and explanation of benefits on each outdoor exercise equipment. In addition, the perspective of rehabilitation science is added to each equipment to educate users to utilise the facilities safely and effectively. The team have also prepared a section for caregivers with advice and reminders on correct postures and proper usage. When caregivers accompany older adults to use these outdoor exercise facilities, they can help to observe and remind older adult users to exercise with correct posture and use the equipment properly. This will enhance the safety and effective use of outdoor exercise equipment.\n\nThe contents in the apps could assist older adults to utilise the facilities safely and effectively. Improvement in daily physical activity level will enhance their self-care ability, level of independence, as well as improving quality of life.\n\nDr Janet Lee and Dr. Arnold Wong\nPrincipal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator",

			"Safety precautions when we using outdoor exercise equipment\n\nBelow are the general safety guidelines suggested by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department:\n\n1. All the fitness equipment in the Corner should be used at regular and appropriate pace. If in doubt, consult a medical professional beforehand.\n\n2. Warm up for 10 to 15 minutes before using the fitness equipment and do 8 to 10 minutes of cool-down afterwards.\n\n3. Do not exercise when you are hungry or full. Wait 1 to 1½ hours after meal before doing any strenuous exercise. Do not drink alcohol before exercise.\n\n4. Wear comfortable and air-permeable clothes and flat-heeled sports shoes.\n\n5. To prevent injury due to misuse of the fitness equipment, read the operation instructions carefully before using it.\n\n6. Make sure the fitness equipment functions properly before using it. If it does not work properly or is out of order, inform the staff in the park immediately.Do not attempt to fix it yourself.\n\n7. Pay attention to your physical condition and limitations. If you feel unwell, stop exercising immediately and seek help from the staff or others in the park.\n\nFall risk management\n\nExercising at outdoor gives health benefits, however, one should note that outdoor environment increase risk of falls due to reasons like uneven walking surfaces, fall hazards like curbs or clutter, poor lighting or inclement weather. \n\nWhat can we do to reduce risk of falling in the outdoor environment?\n\n1. Put on slippery-proof footwears.\n\n2. Avoid using the equipment in the dark (Not noticing objects on the floor).\n\n3. Take a seat immediate when feeling unwell.\n\n4. Walk and use the equipment with care.\n\n5. Check the equipment before stepping on it and using it.\n\n6. Bring a companion.\n\n7. Be aware to any changes in the environment, such as the weather and the road condition.",

			"If you answered NO honestly to all PAR-Q questions, you can be reasonably sure that you can:\n\nStart becoming much more physically active – begin slowly and build up gradually. This is the safest and easiest way to go.\n\nTake part in a fitness appraisal – this is an excellent way to determine your basic fitness so that you can plan the best way for you to live actively. It is also highly recommended that you have your blood pressure evaluated. If your reading is over 144/94, talk with your doctor before you start becoming much more physically active.\n\nDELAY BECOMING MUCH MORE ACTIVE:\n\nIf you are not feeling well because of a temporary illness such as a cold or a fever – wait until you feel better; or\n\nIf you are or may be pregnant – talk to your doctor before you start becoming more active.",

Tell your doctor about this questionnaire and which questions you answered YES.\n\nYou may be able to do any activity you want — as long as you start slowly and build up gradually. Or, you may need to restrict your activities to those which are safe for you. Talk with your doctor about the kinds of activities you wish to participate in and follow his/her advice.\n\nFind out which community programs are safe and helpful for you.",

			"Regular physical activity is fun and healthy, and increasingly more people are starting to become more active every day. Being more active is very safe for most people. However, some people should check with their doctor before they start becoming much more physically active.\n\nIf you are planning to become much more physically active than you are now, start by answering the seven questions in the box below. If you are between the ages of 15 and 69, the PAR-Q will tell you if you should check with your doctor before you start. If you are over 69 years of age, and you are not used to being very active, check with your doctor.\n\nCommon sense is your best guide when you answer these questions. Please read the questions carefully and answer each one honestly (YES or NO).\n\n1. Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor?\n\n2. Do you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity?\n\n3. In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical activity?\n\n4. Do you lose your balance because of dizziness or do you ever lose consciousness?\n\n5. Do you have a bone or joint problem (for example, back, knee or hip) that could be made worse by a change in your physical activity?\n\n6. Is your doctor currently prescribing drugs (for example, water pills) for your blood pressure or heart condition?\n\n7. Do you know of any other reason why you should not do physical activity?",

			"手機應用程式簡介\n\n戶外健體設施手機應用程式\n\n香港自2002年開始在戶外設置適合長者使用的戶外健體設施。2016年開始，為配合活齡城市發展的願景及加強居家安老配套設施，香港政府加大力度在各地區設置更多的戶外健體設施。本地研究顯示這些設施提供了獨特的平台給于不同身體狀況的長者在社區保持恆常運動習慣，促進身心健康。\n\n在社區，已經有一部份長者懂得好好利用戶外健體設施協助自己維持恆常運動習慣，也有一部份長者並不認識這些健體設施亦不懂得如何安全有效地使用。有見及此，香港理工大學康復治療科學系的專家團隊為每一部戶外健體設施編寫了更詳細的介紹，為每一部運動器材增加了康復科學角度提醒使用者如何安全及有效地使用這些設施，亦增加了“給照顧者的提示”部份，希望照顧者如果帶同長者去使用設施時會提點及觀察他們的運動姿勢及使用方法是否正確，以提升運動儀器使用的安全及有效程度。\n\n我們希望程式的內容能夠協助長者安全及有效地使用設施，增加日常活動量以提升生活自理能力及提升生活質素。\n\n李樂真博士及黃宇樂博士\n首席研究員及聯合首席研究員",
