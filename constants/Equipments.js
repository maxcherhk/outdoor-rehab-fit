					"First, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your hips down, slightly bending the knees to form a squatted position. Pay attention to not letting the knees go beyond the toes.\n\nGrip the handles with both hands and then rotate the Tai Chi wheel in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.\n\nWhile rotating the Tai Chi wheel, remember to maintain good posture. Look straight ahead, lift your head upwards, and extend your spine. Keep your shoulders away from your ears, roll your shoulders back, and lift up your chest. Be mindful not to overarch your lower back; you can adjust the curve of your lower back by pointing your tailbone forward.\n\nNow, let's try rotating the wheel clockwise with both hands. Remember to use moderate force and maintain a steady rotation speed, avoiding sudden changes in speed.\n\nNext, let's try rotating the wheel counterclockwise with both hands. Again, use moderate force and maintain an even rotation speed.\n\nNow, let's try pushing the wheel clockwise with the right hand and counterclockwise with the left hand. Remember to use moderate force and maintain a steady rotation speed.\n\nFinally, let's reverse the directions. Again, use moderate force and maintain an even rotation speed, avoiding sudden changes in speed.",

					"Rotating the Tai Chi wheel can improve the mobility and flexibility of the upper limb joints and muscles.\n\nThe squatting position can strengthen the muscles of the lower limbs.",
				ptTip:
					'Gentle joint movements help patients with "frozen shoulder" and shoulder arthritis maintain the range of motion of their shoulder joints and alleviate shoulder pain. When using the Tai Chi wheel, the use of force and range of rotation should not be too intense and should be kept within the range of motion that does not worsen the pain level.\n\nSemi-squat training benefits patients with hip and knee arthritis by strengthening the gluteus maximus and quadriceps muscles. It also helps seniors with poor balance to prevent falls. When performing a semi-squat, pay attention to the position of your back and legs. Keep your back as straight as possible, and ensure that your knees are aligned with your toes, and pointing straight ahead. Be cautious not to let your knees turn inward or stand with an out-toeing position.',
				otTip:
					"By engaging in the practice of rotating the dial with both hands, users can enhance the flexibility of their upper limb joints, making various everyday actions such as table wiping, object lifting, showering, and dressing significantly easier and more effortless.\n\nMoreover, practicing squat can strengthen the lower limb muscles and provides assistance for specific activities that involve transitioning from a seated position. For instance, standing up from a toilet seat becomes notably more manageable.",
				careTip:
					"Observe and remind the user to keep the back straight while rotating the Tai Chi wheel. Keep the eyes looking forward, shoulders roll back, and chest lifted.\n\nPay attention to whether the user's knees are beyond their toes. If the user experiences pain in the knee joints, they should avoid the semi-squat position.",

					"首先，雙腳分開站立，企係轉動扶手前方，站立嘅時候雙腳距離同膊頭一樣咁闊。兩隻手可以緊握住個手柄，然後慢慢向前轉動個扶手。\n\n轉動扶手嘅同時記得保持良好的姿勢。眼望前方，頭向上頂，延伸脊柱。唔好縮膊，膊頭遠離耳仔，膊頭轉向後，挺起胸膛。\n\n我地宜家試下雙手向前轉動個扶手。記得力度要適中，轉速亦都要平均，唔好時快時慢。",

				ptTip:
					"轉動扶手的練習有助於保持上肢關節的靈活性。轉動扶手時，速度和力度不用太大，應保持在一個不會加劇疼痛程度的範圍內。\n\n持續的上肢活動除了能鍛鍊上肢關節的靈活性，亦能增強心肺功能。適量的有氧運動能夠幫助新冠肺炎康復者等心肺功能較弱的人提升心肺功能。有氧運動亦能控制體重和降低三高（高血壓、高血脂、高血糖），減低患上心血管疾病的風險。做運動時，應保持在自己覺得輕鬆至有點辛苦的難度，運動時應該能夠與人持續對話。",
